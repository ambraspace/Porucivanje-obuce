**NOTE**

This tool was written in 2005.

**DESCRIPTION**

This application has been used in a shoe retail company in B/H to transfer shoe collections to all
retail stores. In 2005 this was done over the phone line.

Since the users in retail stores have not been technically very skilled, the application has been designed
to be effortless on their side.

After the store manager selected the models, color variants and sizes, the operator at the headquorthes
would transfer the selection to the server.

After the selections from all the stores had been collected the operator would make an order from the supplier.
